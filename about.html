I'm Heten Patil, a third-year undergraduate student driven by curiosity and the constant pursuit of self-improvement.<br />
I’m currently preparing for both the GATE and GRE exams with the aim of pursuing a Master’s in Artificial Intelligence from a top German university in the Winter 2027 intake.<br />
Despite starting out with minimal technical background, I’ve actively worked to build a strong foundation—learning Python, C++, full-stack web development, and core computer science concepts.<br />
I'm also engaged in academic research, internships, and personal projects to deepen my practical understanding.<br />
I balance my academic goals with a structured gym routine and a focus on mental clarity, while also exploring creative outlets like poetry and visual storytelling.<br />
This portfolio reflects not only the skills I’ve built, but also the mindset that drives me—intentional, resourceful, and evolving.

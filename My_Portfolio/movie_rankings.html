<h3>Old Boy</h3>
<p>This movie is the greatest piece of dark fiction I have ever seen.<br />
     This movie fucked me up and not in a bad way. I was traumatized and amazed.</p>
<h3>A Silent Voice</h3>
<p>This movie made me cry, smile and I related to it like I had just found a memory in a different shade. <br />
    This movie is one of the most recommended movie for any age group above 10.</p>
<h3>Gangs of Wasseypur</h3>
<p>This dark gritty tale of rural U.P. was just the holy grail for my teenage mind that I was looking.<br />
    Why this was so great, see and then you tell me...</p>
